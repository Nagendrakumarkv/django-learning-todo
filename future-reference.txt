Day 1 Goal: Create the project, set up the file structure, and define your database table (Model).

Follow these steps exactly in your terminal (Command Prompt/PowerShell or Terminal).

Step 1: The Setup
We need a clean room for your project so it doesn't interfere with other Python stuff on your computer.

Create a folder:
mkdir django_todo
cd django_todo

Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

(You should see (venv) appear at the start of your command line line. This means you are inside the isolated environment.)

Install Django:
pip install django

Step 2: Start the Engine
Now we generate the standard Django file structure.

Start the Project: (Note the . at the end. It prevents Django from creating an extra redundant folder).
django-admin startproject myproject .

Create the App: Django projects are made of "apps". We will call ours tasks.
python manage.py startapp tasks

Connect them (CRITICAL STEP): Django doesn't know the tasks app exists yet.
Open myproject/settings.py in your code editor.
Scroll down to the INSTALLED_APPS list
Add 'tasks', to the list.

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    # ... other defaults ...
    'tasks',  # <--- ADD THIS LINE
]

Step 3: Define the Data (The Model)
We need to tell the database what a "Task" looks like.

Open tasks/models.py.
Delete the code there and paste this:

from django.db import models

class Task(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
    completed = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

CharField: Small text (like a title).
TextField: Large text (like a description).
BooleanField: True/False (checkbox).
auto_now_add: Automatically saves the exact time you created the task.   

Step 4: Build the Database
Now we translate that Python code into a real Database (SQLite).

Make Migrations (Create the blueprint):
python manage.py makemigrations

You should see a message saying "Create model Task".

Migrate (Build the house):
python manage.py migrate

Step 5: Verify it works
Let's turn the lights on.

Run the server:
python manage.py runserver

Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/. You should see the little rocket ship that says "The install worked successfully! Congratulations!"
